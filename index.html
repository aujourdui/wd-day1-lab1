      <h1>VOLLEYBALL VICTORY</h1>
      <h2>CLAREMORRIS GIRLS WIN ALL-IRELAND TITLE IN STYLE</h2>
      <p>
        Victory seemed unlikely. Mount Saint Michael were two sets down and St.
        Leo’s certainly had the upper hand in the third set, dominating 9 points
        to 2. Each time St. Leo’s scored, they pounded the ground in unison,
        further intimidating an already shaky Claremorris team. So how, in these
        circumstances, did they snatch victory from the jaws of almost certain
        defeat?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The first set seemed to suggest two teams who were equally matched.
        Michael’s fought point for point against a Leo’s team whose defence was
        almost impenetrable, yet Edel Nolan managed to hit home some impressive
        spikes. However, as the set drew to a close, they found themselves
        unable to finish the job and St Leo’s stormed into the second set with a
        25-22 win in the first set under their belt.
      </p>
      <br />

        This is where it all went wrong for Claremorris. Having lost the first
        set, their nerves took over and their difficulty settling into the match
        was evident in a plethora of unforced errors, despite excellent
        positioning by Nikki Hanley and impact substitutions by Lisa McGreal and
        Jackie Prendergast. They lost the second set 25-19 and hope began to
        fade for their 200+ supporters.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The third set began in similar fashion but sensing that they now had
        nothing to lose – except of course the All-Ireland Title – the team
        lifted their game tremendously, aided by the now deafening cries of
        their desperate supporters, led by Lisa Brett and Chloe Hughes.
        Strategic use of time outs by coach Fionnghuala King saw the girls
        finally settle into the match. She no doubt reminded them of their team
        mantra – no matter how badly things seem to be going ‘don’t lose your
        marbles’. Stephanie Mellet had a great run of serves and made a stunning
        save at this crucial point in the set. Aisling Croghan made some
        unbelievable hits from the wings and Edel Nolan shone as the driving
        force behind Mount St Michael’s incredible comeback. They won the third
        set 25-16 and St Leo’s game began to fall apart.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A fear of losing now defined their play, and they frequently only used
        two of their three hits, eager to simply get the ball across the net.
        Meanwhile, Claremorris grew in confidence, scoring a resounding victory
        in the fourth set 25-13.
      </p>
      <br />

        As it finally dawned that Claremorris could actually win this match, the
        excitement and tension in the arena reached fever pitch, and the daddies
        on the sideline (Gerry Croghan & Con Nolan) riled up the crowd, ably
        assisted by vice-principal Margaret Burke. However, St Leo’s finally
        realised that it was still all to play for and once again their defence,
        led by Sinead Ruth, became near-impossible to break down. Edel Nolan
        made three excellent spikes in a row only to find each and every one
        returned. Long rallies defined the 5th and final set (first to 15 points
        but the team must win by 2 points) and every time Claremorris inched
        ahead St Leo’s reeled them in again. Finally, however, they reached 14 –
        13 and faced their first match point. Sinead Croghan, whose strength was
        such a defining feature of her play up to this point, unfortunately hit
        the serve long and it was back to stalemate. Two more match points
        followed, but Mount St Michael couldn’t seem to finish Leo’s off. At
        last, with 2 sets all and 17-16 on the scoreboard, Nikki Hanley served,
        raced forward to set the ball and Edel Nolan spiked the girls to the
        sweetest victory of their lives. No wonder, then, she was named Most
        Valuable Player of the match.
